# freeCodeCamp/Data Analysis with Python Projects/Sea Level Predictor

In this project I used pandas to read data from a .csv file containing a dataset of the global average sea level change since 1880 and after that, I made a scatter plot using matplotlib having represented all years from the dataset on the x-axis and the sea level in inches on the y-axis. Also, with linregress function from Scipy.stats I represented two best fit lines, one going from the very first year registered in the dataset to the 2050 and the other one starting from 2000 and going also to the 2050. The red line represents the first best fit which predicts sea level according to the data recorded for all years and the yellow line represents the second best fit which predicts sea level based only on the data recorded from the year 2000. Below you can see the visual representation of the plot described above:
